		<h2>Shop Policies</h2>
		<h3>How it works</h3>
		<p>All of my items are made to order, which means you have full control! If you like an item from my shop as-is, just pick your color(s) during the checkout process. If one of my items catches your eye but you wish it was longer or wider, or had a pom-pom or earflaps, or whatever else you can imagine, just hit Customize and I'll send you an estimate for your requested adjustments. If you saw something online or have a picture in your head of something you want, submit a Special Request form with a link or picture and I'll give you an estimate for that! All in all, if you want it, I want to make it for you.</p>
		<h3>Shipping and Delivery</h3>
		<p>I promise to ship your item within 2 weeks of the day you place your order. Usually I can get it done in less than a week, but during peak seasons it gets a little crazy. I charge a flat shipping rate of $5 in the US and $15 internationally, but if you live locally to me, contact me for a Free Shipping coupon code so we can just make an exchange in person!</p>

		<h2>My Story</h2>
		<p>
			When I was a kid, my aunt taught me how to crochet a chain of yarn to attach beads around the edges of my socks. When I was in middle school, my grandma taught me how to single and double crochet, and I made myself a massive blue and yellow afghan to match my sunflower-themed bedroom. In high school, I made a couple of scarves and baby blankets for baby-showers and birthday gifts, but my passion really kicked in when I went to college. I started seeing these awesome oversized cowl scarves everywhere I went, and whenever I asked where they came from, some stylish girl would always say some store that charged them like 40 bucks for the thing. I thought to myself, "I bet I could make that!" and pretty soon I realized there was huge market potential on campus.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, with the help of several youtube tutorials and some great patterns I bought and found online, I started busting out hipster hats and cowl scarves like it was nobody's business. Sophomore year I probably sold 20 of my chunky crocheted cowls in the span of a couple of months. Before long, someone sent me a picture of the Burton Bear cowl and asked me if I could make it. So, I bought a pattern, picked up knitting, and started experimenting left and right with all sorts of knitting and crochet patterns and ideas of my own! After a while, I realized I had a good thing going and decided to share some coziness with the rest of the world. Hence, my little shop was born! I hope you like what you see here, because I sure do love making it happen for you. :)
